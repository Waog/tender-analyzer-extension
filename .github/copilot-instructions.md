# Purpose of this repository / project

This Project is a chrome extension build with WXT. It's purpose is to alow the user to analyze public tenders, by processing their websites and files (zip, pdf, html, word, excel, openOffice, etc.), concatenating the content into one big LLM prompt, open a new browser tab and insert the prompt into an LLM chat.

# For Agent Mode

In agent mode, complete the requested work without extra explanation unless I explicitly ask for advice or an explanation. Finish the implementation and return working code.

When you execute CLI commands in agent mode, there is a bug that can make you inspect the CLI result before it has finished executing. Therefore, always run a second trivial command (for example, `echo`) before reading the output of the first command.

# For Chat Mode

When you are in chat mode: Before making high-level modifications like creating or modifying the public interface of a package, class, interface, or component, give me multiple suggestions/options for how the public interface of that class/component could look. Present them in a very brief numbered list, which only expects me to choose a number. Only present how the modified item will be consumed. Mark the recommended option as recommended.

When you are in chat mode: Prefer using the VSCode tools you have access to over custom command line execution. E.g. access VSCodes Testing Extension, instead of executing `npm test`, use VSCodes Search extension instead of `grep`, etc.

# General Coding Guidelines

Prefer minimal changes over large refactors, unless the code is very bad or you are asked to do a refactor.

Prefer using libraries and reusing existing code over writing new code. Suggest new libraries instead of reinventing the wheel. Brief and non-duplicated code is always more maintainable and preferred.

Always implement things according to clean code practices, especially:

Apply the newspaper metaphor: top-level general functions, which call others, at the top of the file; low-level detailed helper functions, which are called, at the bottom of the file. I.e., no callee shall be above its caller in a file.

Avoid spaghetti code, pyramids of doom, and callback hells: Ensure that all statements within a function operate at the same level of abstraction—either orchestrating high-level steps or performing low-level details, but not both. Instead of having deeply nested loops and if-statements in one code snippet, extract named helper methods.

Avoid comments: instead of writing comments describing your code blocks, extract methods with speaking names to wrap these code blocks. (Exception: Don't remove existing `TODO`, `FIXME`, etc. unless you fixed them. Don't remove concrete examples, e.g., input string and output of a regex. Don't remove information which can't be derived from viewing the code.)

Assume existing code as best practice: Don't make up your own code style; instead, mimic existing code styles, unless you think existing code style is non-optimal.
Prefer placing import statements at the top of the file, rather than using inline imports, requires, or Fully Qualified Class Names.

## Commit Message Guidelines

All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, as enforced by commitlint and the commit message editor configuration. A valid commit message should have the following structure:

```
<type>[<scope>]: <emoji> <short description>

<body>

<footer>
```

- **type**: One of:
  - `fix`: A bug fix; triggers patch version bump and new release.
  - `feat`: A new feature; triggers minor version bump and new release.
  - `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
  - `chore`: Updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
  - `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes
  - `perf`: A code change that improves performance
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `revert`: Revert a previous commit
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

- **scope** (optional): One of:
  - `frontend`
  - `backend`
  - `infrastructure`
  - `docs`
  - `root`
  - `multiple`
    Use a scope to provide additional contextual information, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

- **emoji**: One of:
  - `🪲` bugfix (`fix`)
  - `♻️` refactor (`refactor`)
  - `✨` add feature (`feat`)
  - `🗑️` remove feature
  - `📦` build process, CI/CD (`build`, `ci`)
  - `🚧` WIP - squash later
  - `📄` Documentation (`docs`)

- **short description**: Brief summary of the change.

- **body** (optional): More detailed description.

- **footer** (optional): Additional information, such as:
  - `BREAKING CHANGE: ...` (triggers major version bump and new release.)
  - `NATIVE CHANGE` (if Expo OTA publish is insufficient and a new native build and app store release is required)

**When to use which type and emoji:**

- Use `feat` + `✨` for new features.
- Use `fix` + `🪲` for bug fixes.
- Use `refactor` + `♻️` for code refactoring that does not add features or fix bugs.
- Use `docs` + `📄` for documentation changes.
- Use `build` or `ci` + `📦` for build process or CI/CD changes.
- Use `chore` for maintenance tasks that do not affect production code.
- Use `test` for adding or correcting tests.
- Use `style` for formatting or stylistic changes.
- Use `revert` for reverting previous commits.
- Use `🗑️` for removing features.
- Use `🚧` for work-in-progress commits that should be squashed later.

**Examples:**

```
feat(frontend): ✨ add user login page

Added a new login page with form validation.

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication flow has changed.
```

```
fix(backend): 🪲 handle null pointer in user service
```
